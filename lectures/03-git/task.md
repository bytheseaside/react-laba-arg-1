# Git practice

Push your previous homework which you did for [HTML lecture](https://github.com/qaprosoft/react-laba-arg-1/blob/main/lectures/02-html/task.md) to your homework folder

### Definition of done

- You should use this repository - https://github.com/qaprosoft/react-laba-arg-1 (if you don't have access please let me know)
- You need to create a folder in the homeworks folder. The name should be firstName-lastName. E.g. for a developer Mykhailo Melnyk the name would be mykhailo-melnyk. The Sub-folder should have the same name as a lecture name.
- Every branch in upstream must starts with a prefix that is based on user initials. For example, for a developer Mykhailo Melnyk prefix would be mm-. In case of prefix collisions in the future the common rule is to dive deeper into the last name, for example: mmel-.
- Create PR
- Once PR is created you have to do the following things:
  - Assign your mentor as a reviewer
  - Ping the mentor about the PR ;)

Good luck!
